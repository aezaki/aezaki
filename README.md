**`Software Developer (Mobile/Full Stack)`**

I'm a Computer Science student pursuing a career as a software developer. All coding projects are built with a specefic purpose to learn new concepts and refine existing skills. The next steps I am looking to take are expanding on the real worl experience I have and landing new opportunities to continue my software journey and find new ways to impact the developer world.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Andrew's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive University of Waterloo computer science student with little to no coding experience, and a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world. And all the while, teaching myself swift and iOS development with a dream to build my own app, which I am proud to say was able to do. I'm still in the process of pursing my degree and through interships and my own pursuit of further education I have been able to build up my portfolio and projects I am proud of. However, I'm not done, I know this is just the beginning and I hope to continue to land new opportunities and internships that will further my education and allow me to keep contributing to this programming world I used to dream to be a part of. Looking back at a few years ago being a complete novice, with no coding experience and starting one of the most competitive computer science programns in the country it was terrifying; there were several times where I contemplated quiting, even coming close a few times. Now I near my graduation and know this is the path I was meant to be on, no matter how difficult and how many failures and rejections came along the way and will continue to come I have no doubt in my mind this programming world is where I belong.
